# Frontend Mentor - Results summary component solution
## Overview
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

To get better at the use of position absolute and relative.
And also to practice the mobile first approach.

### Continued development

Will try to implement the use of SASS on the exercise, as the style.css gets bigger.
